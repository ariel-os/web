To facilitate your workflows, Ariel OS can be built to run natively on your PC, as described in the book entry on [native target](https://ariel-os.github.io/ariel-os/dev/docs/book/native-target.html). We are currently working on adding functionalities for networking to the native port. 

To complement this, and to further facilitate reproducible experiments on popular microcontroller hardware, you can also consider building Ariel OS to run it on a popular open-access testbed: [Slices IoT-LAB](https://www.iot-lab.info/) which provides bare-metal access to various types of boards. To test that, you can follow [this guide](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os/wiki/Running-Ariel-OS-on-IoT%E2%80%90LAB).
